 <p>This post shows how to accomplish custom metal work with the aid of simple tooling from the scrap bin.
 This kind of tooling is invaluable when performing automotive restoration, whether going for custom made
 creations or original body styling.  Not only is the tooling going to be simple to make, it’s going to be super cheap!
 The example job is making a pair of defroster/heater vents for the 1938 Chevrolet Pepsi truck dashboard</p>

        <p>We’ve began an exciting custom Chevy truck project for the Pepsi bottling company.  We were commissioned by
        Newberry Motors GM dealership to undertake the custom metal work and restoration in their home town of Newberry,
        MI.  After spending 7 weeks there, we completed the first stage of the metal work build.  After discussions and
        meetings, the owner and Newberry Motors decided to send the truck back with me to my shop in Denver, Colorado.  This is exciting for the Metal Surgeon as our new goal is to complete the whole project and deliver back to Michigan completed and ready for the 4th July Michigan Parade next year</p>

<p>So, let’s tell you about the 1938 Chevy truck and what we’ll be doing to the truck.  The objective is to have the truck
drive like a modern vehicle while in keeping the classic looks and style.  On our arrival in Newberry, a freshly built chassis with a new drive train was ready and waiting
to mount the dismantled cab and components onto.  As mentioned, the overall look of the truck will be kept in line with the original look, but with subtle custom touches.  The planned modifications are as follows:</p>

After building the radiator shell, we decided to build some custom panel work to compliment the classic style of
the radiator shell.  We stayed with the original 1932 Ford parameters on the hood and sides but opted to create
some custom scoops.  The scoops create three things:  rigidity in the panel, air flow, and uniqueness, as the
panels you see below are all one of a kind.
</p>

</div><p>To help create the scoop work in the panels, we made a hammer form jig.  Each panel was clamped to the jig,
then the aluminum was ‘jig chased’ into the depth of the jig, after annealing it (a heat treatment to make the aluminum
soft and workable).
